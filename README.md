# prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto - This project was completed based on the specification provided and no additional items (i.e. menus) were added. Since this was a fairly simple layout, <div> tags were not employed. My recommendation to the client would be to add in menus and create divisions/sections within the layout for easier expandability.
